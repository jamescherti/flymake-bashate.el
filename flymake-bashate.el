;;; Commentary:
;; The flymake-bashate Emacs package provides a Flymake backend for bashate,
;; enabling real-time style checking for Bash shell scripts within Emacs.
;;
;; (Bashate is a Bash script syntax checker, enforcing a set of style and syntax
;; rules to ensure that your scripts are consistent, clean, and easy to read.)
;;
;; (This package can also work with Flycheck: simply use the `flymake-flycheck`
;; package, which allows any Emacs Flymake backend to function as a Flycheck
;; checker.)*
;;
;; Installation from MELPA:
;; ------------------------
;; (use-package flymake-bashate
;;   :ensure t
;;   :commands flymake-bashate-setup
;;   :hook (((bash-ts-mode sh-mode) . flymake-bashate-setup)
;;          ((bash-ts-mode sh-mode) . flymake-mode))
;;   :custom
;;   (flymake-bashate-max-line-length 80))
;;
;; Customizations:
;; ---------------
;; To make bashate ignore specific Bashate rules, such as E003 (ensure all
;; indents are a multiple of 4 spaces) and E006 (check for lines longer than 79
;; columns), set the following variable:
;;   (setq flymake-bashate-ignore "E003,E006")
;;
;; To define the maximum line length for Bashate to check:
;;   (setq flymake-bashate-max-line-length 80)
;;
;; To change the path or filename of the Bashate executable:
;;   (setq flymake-bashate-executable "/opt/different-directory/bin/bashate")
